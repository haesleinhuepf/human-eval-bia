This step is optional depending on what kind of normalization or scaling of the kernel values makes sense for your specific use case.\n3. **Apply Convolution**: Use a suitable function to perform the actual convolution operation between the image and the kernel. In this case, `scipy.signal.convolve2d` is used with default parameters except for specifying 'same' mode which means that the output will have the same size as the input image, and it will be padded with zeros around the edges to ensure that the filtered image is of the same size as the original.

For this specific task, `scikit-image`'s label function might be particularly helpful because it often returns an array where each unique value represents a different connected component (object).\n3. **Identify Border Objects**: You need to create a mask that identifies which pixels are on the edge of the image and check if any labeled object touches these edges.\n4. **Remove the Labels**: Once you identify objects touching the border, remove their labels from the original label image.\n\nLet's start by importing necessary libraries:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom skimage import measure, morphology\n```\n\nNow, let's define the function `remove_labels_on_edges`:\n\n```python\ndef remove_labels_on_edges(label_image):\n    # Ensure the label image is a binary or labeled image where each pixel is marked with its corresponding object label.\n    \n    # Step 1: Create a border mask that identifies pixels on the edge of the image.\n    rows, cols = label_image.shape\n    border_mask = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    border_mask[0, :] = True  # Top row\n    border_mask[-1, :] = True  # Bottom row\n    border_mask[:, 0] = True  # Left column\n    border_mask[:, -1] = True  # Right column\n    \n    # Step 2: Identify objects that touch the border.\n    labeled_array, _ = measure.label(label_image, return_num=True, connectivity=2)\n    border_objects = np.unique(labeled_array[border_mask])\n    \n    # Step 3: Create a mask to exclude these labels from the original label image.\n    exclusion_mask = np.ones((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    for obj in border_objects:\n        if obj != 0:  # Assuming 0 is the background or unlabelled area\n            exclusion_mask[labeled_array == obj] = False\n    \n    # Step 4: Apply the mask to remove the specified labels from the label image.\n    result_image = label_image.copy()\n    result_image[exclusion_mask] = 0  # Set these pixels to background (usually 0) if they are part of a removed object\n    \n    return result_image\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input `label_image` is a binary or labeled image where each pixel has its corresponding object label.

This might involve thresholding, segmentation, or other techniques depending on the images.\n5. **Store Results**: Store filenames and their corresponding counts in a dictionary.\n6. **Return the Dictionary**: Return the dictionary containing all filenames and their label counts.\n\n### Import Libraries\nWe will use `os` for file handling, `tifffile` for loading `.tif` files, and possibly other libraries if needed for advanced image processing or counting.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport tifffile as tiff\nfrom skimage import io\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef workflow_batch_process_folder_count_labels(folder_location):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function goes through all .tif image files in a specified folder, loads the images and counts labels each image. \n    It returns a dictionary with filenames and corresponding counts.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    # List all files in the directory\n    for filename in os.listdir(folder_location):\n        if filename.endswith(\".tif\"):\n            file_path = os.path.join(folder_location, filename)\n            \n            # Load the image\n            img = tiff.imread(file_path)  # Using tifffile to load .tif images\n            \n            # Count unique labels in the image (assuming it's a binary or multi-label image)\n            if len(img.shape) == 2:  # Grayscale image, no need for advanced counting\n                unique_labels = set(img.ravel())\n            else:  # RGB or other multi-dimensional images, might require specific processing\n                labels = img.reshape(-1, img.shape[-1])\n                unique_labels = set(tuple(label) for label in labels)\n            \n            result[filename] = len(unique_labels)\n    \n    return dict(result)\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the images are grayscale and flat arrays where each pixel is a label.

The function first converts the image to grayscale if it's not already, normalizes the kernel for easier computation, pads the image to handle edge cases, and finally performs the convolution operation by sliding the kernel over each part of the padded image, calculating the value at each position in the convolved image."}

It should return a new array where the axes are transposed, meaning the first two dimensions swap roles.\n2. **Use NumPy for Efficient Transposition**: Since the input is likely to be a numpy array, we can leverage the `numpy.transpose` function which allows easy transposition of axes. However, if the image is 3D, it needs to be handled differently since `numpy.transpose` will only handle up to 3 dimensions directly and might require specific handling for higher dimensions.\n3. **Handle Dimensions**: If the image is a 2D array, simply use `numpy.transpose` with axes set to (1, 0). If it's a 3D array, use `numpy.transpose` with axes set to (1, 0, 2) where the dimensions are ordered as [height, width, channels] or similar depending on how the image data is organized in memory.\n4. **Return the Transposed Array**: Convert the transposed array back to the expected output format and return it.\n\n### Importing Libraries:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\n### Function Definition:\n```python\ndef transpose_image_axes(image):\n    # Check if the image is 2D or 3D\n    if len(image.shape) == 2:\n        # For a 2D image, simply transpose the axes\n        transposed_image = np.transpose(image, (1, 0))\n    elif len(image.shape) == 3:\n        # For a 3D image, transpose the first two axes and leave the third as is\n        transposed_image = np.transpose(image, (1, 0, 2))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported image shape.

In this case, we'll use `numpy` for array manipulation and `skimage.measure` to handle label images if they are not directly compatible with standard numpy functions.\n2. **Identify Unique Labels**: Use `np.unique()` to find all unique labels in the label image. This function returns a sorted array of unique elements from the input array, which can be filtered out to exclude background (usually represented by 0).\n3. **Filter Background**: Skip the pixel count for the background if it exists (typically labeled as 0) since we're interested in pixel counts per object or region.\n4. **Create Masks and Count Pixels**: For each unique label found, create a mask that selects pixels belonging to that specific label. Use `np.sum()` on this mask to count the number of non-zero (black) pixels for each label. Append these counts to a list.\n5. **Return Results**: Return the list of tuples where each tuple contains the label and its corresponding pixel count. This function should return a list of pairs, where each pair consists of a label value and the total number of pixels that have this label in the input image."}

This might involve matrix operations or convolutions in the frequency domain.\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the deconvolved image.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef deconvolve_image(image, kernel_image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deconvolve an image with a kernel_image and return the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert images to float32 numpy arrays\n    img = np.float32(image) / 255.0\n    ker = np.float32(kernel_image) / 255.0\n    \n    # Perform deconvolution using cv2.deblur\n    result = cv2.deblur(img, ker)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the `cv2.deblur` function can be used for deconvolution, which is a common operation in image processing libraries like OpenCV. If you have access to a different library or need a more complex method for deconvolution, adjust the implementation accordingly."}

This ensures that the kernel is large enough to cover all necessary pixels for dilation and erosion operations within the specified radius.\n   \n2. **Dilation Operation**: The binary image is dilated using the created structuring element. Dilation expands the areas where the structuring element covers 'true' bits (usually representing foreground or 1s in a binary image), effectively filling small holes and joining neighboring objects.\n\n3. **Erosion Operation**: Following dilation, the result is subjected to an erosion operation with the same structuring element. Erosion contracts the areas where the structuring element covers 'true' bits, removing small protrusions that may have been introduced or enlarged by the dilation step. This process effectively closes narrow breaks and holes in the binary image.\n\nThe final output of these operations is a more closed version of the original binary image, which can be useful for various image processing tasks where filling small gaps and connecting objects are desired outcomes."}
