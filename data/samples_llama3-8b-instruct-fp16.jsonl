We define the `subsample_image` function, which takes an image and an optional subsampling rate (`n`) as arguments.\n3. We convert the input image to a numpy array for easier manipulation.\n4. We use slicing to subsample the array by skipping every nth pixel in both X and Y directions (i.e., `[::n, ::n]`).\n5. We convert the subsampled array back to a PIL Image using `Image.fromarray`, specifying the data type as `uint8` for 8-bit unsigned integer pixels.\n\nNote that I assumed the image is an instance of `PIL.Image`, and the function returns a new `PIL.Image`.

The binary image returned by `threshold` function has only 0s and 255s, which represent black and white pixels respectively.\n\nFinally, it counts the number of positive pixels (pixels with values greater than 0) using NumPy's `sum` function."}
