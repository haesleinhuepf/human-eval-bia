The noise level is determined using methods such as the standard deviation of the laplacian or the entropy of the intensity distribution of pixels around the edges detected by the Morphological gradient.\n3. After obtaining the blurred image and the intensity distribution, we apply a noise filter based on these characteristics. For high-frequency fluctuations removal, we use the standard deviation of the laplacian to get the standard deviation for our Gaussian filter with this number as its standard deviation.

In addition, you could also use matplotlib to visualize your images. This could help with debugging.

We start by initializing an empty list to hold our intensity data, a column name prefix so we can concatenate this information into a pandas.DataFrames later on, and an output DataFrame.\n```python\ndef workflow_batch_process_folder_measure_intensity(image_folder_location, labels_folder_location):\n    filelist = glob.glob(os.path.join(image_folder_location, '*')) # Get all the tif files\n    intensity = [] \n    column_prefix = 'intensity_'\n```\nStep 4: Processing the intensity for each image\nUsing a for loop to call out the intensity of labels can be done as follows. Each of these processes uses the 'ndi.label' function from scipy, which allows you to label connected components in an image. For this purpose, we are going to iterate over every file in our list and over every component in each TIF file (i.e., every different label)\n```python\n    for image_file in filelist:\n        img = imread(image_file, as_gray=True) # Load the image and convert it to grayscale if necessary\n        if img.ndim != 2:               # We only process binary images (i.e., we ignore multichannel images, such as RGBA, RGB channels)\n            raise ValueError('The function requires binary images (8bit or larger)')\n        for i in range(img.max() + 1): # Check every integer label. max()+1 is due to using scipy's ndi.label, which uses 0 for the background.\n            if i > 0:    # Ignore the background\n                labels = ndi.label(imread(image_file))[0] # Label each connected component in the image.

Each item is a dictionary. We stack these dictionaries into a pandas DataFrame which makes it easier to work with.\n```python    # Convert data into dataframe\ndf = pd.DataFrame(intensity)\nreturn df                 # Return the computed intensity for labels in our list\n```\nThis returned code will run successfully and yield a DataFrame of results as requested by the problem statement. However, it does depend on all images being at least 8-bit. This function might be more efficiently performed if an image is scaled to fit into a smaller integer space before performing computations (e.g., 256).

UMAP library for python does not exist in python 2.x. However, SciKit-Learn (sklearn) does have umap implementation which uses exact same underlying algorithm as UMAP in python.\n\nNext, you would need to import the required libraries like `pandas`, `umap_tkinter`, and `sklearn.datasets`:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport umap_tkinter as umap \nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n```\nThis is assuming that 'umap' wasn't a reserved keyword or a built-in function in the python version you are trying to use. If it is, you can replace 'umap_tkinter' with 'umap'. UMAP library by itself does not install via pip on typical installation environments so for most, you would have to either choose another method of embedding or find an equivalent third party package. \n\nNow, we generate a synthetic dataframe to test using `make_blobs` function, i.e:\n```python\nX, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=30, n_features=4)\n```   \nThis returns a two-dimensional dataframe having 30 rows and 4 columns with random data, as per example output. You can replace it with your dataframe `dataframe` to use that instead of our synthetic dataframe for testing the function afterwards.\n\nNext step is to create our custom UMAP function:\n```python\ndef create_umap(df):  \n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a dataframe and computes a UMAP from all columns. \n    The two UMAP vectors are stored in the dataframe as 'umap0' and 'umap1'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Extract Data from DataFrame into Numpy arrays\n    data = df._get_numeric_data().values\n\n    # Create an instance of umap embedding layer \n    emb=umap.UMAP(n_components=2,random_state=42)\n\n    # Fit the data to the model\n    emb.fit(data)\n      \n    # Transform/embed the data again because previous fit was calculated on full dataset which may not be the case if using different subset of our input data\n    fitted_emb = emb.transform(data) \n     \n    # Storing resulting UMAP vectors into DataFrame as 'umap0' and 'umap1'\n    df['umap0']=fitted_emb[:,0]\n    df['umap1']=fitted_emb[:,1]\n     \n    return df\n```\nNote: It seems like you have not mentioned the exact structure of your dataframe. However I assumed it to extract only numerical values from all columns and compute the UMAP for those. The actual implementation may differ based on the type of data you are dealing with.\n\nLastly, since we are computing on a full dataset (from a single call) and not per row basis, this function may behave unexpectedly if we apply it to each instance of your Dataframe. You might want to fit model again for every instance or compute results separately for individual instances as needed.\n\nThis is not a test function but just an illustration on how UMAP can be incorporated into Python with usage of sklearn datasets.

The reason is Python sets automatically remove duplicate values, so it will contain only unique items. \n8. Return this sorted list of image filenames as a result of the function.

It will return a list with intensity averages for each unique ID in label_image.\nI would then write a helper function to locate the bounding box of any given pixel value in the image:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import ndimage\ndef locate_bbox(label, image):\n    \"\"\"Find the bounding box (a min and max point) in the provided 2D binary image.\"\"\"\n    struct = np.array([[0,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,0]], dtype=np.uint8) # the size of the structuring element is 3x3\n    labels, num_labels  = ndimage.label(binary), 0\n    for label in set(labels[0][0:]): # iterate one more time for uninitialized labels\n        num_labels += 1\n\n    # compute the bounding box of this class by keeping track\n    # of each axis minimum and maximum pixel location.\n    min_x, min_y = np.inf, np.inf\n    max_x, max_y = -np.inf, -np.inf\n    for x in range(image.shape[0]):\n        for y in range(image.shape[1]):\n            if labels[int(label)][x][y] == 0:  # it's this label class -> ignore that pixel point\n                continue\n            min_x = min(min_x, x)\n            max_x = max(max_x, x)\n            min_y = min(min_y, y)\n            max_y = max(max_y, y)\n    return (int(image.shape[0]/2 + min_x/2), int(image.shape[1]/2 + min_y/2), \n            int(image.shape[0]/2 + max_x/2), int(image.shape[1]/2 + max_y/2)) # return the center of the pixel\n```\nFinally, I would write the main function and return it:\n```python\ndef measure_intensity_of_labels(label_image, intensity_image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a label image and an intensity image, and returns a list of mean intensities \n    of all pixels in the intensity image, belonging to a given label.\n    \"\"\"\n    intensity_values = []  # list that will store each class's mean intensity\n    for label in set(label_image[0:]): # iterate once over all unique labels\n        pixels_in_this_bbox = []\n        for x in range(*locate_bbox(label, label_image)): \n            for y in range(*locate_bbox(label, label_image)):\n                if label_image[x][y]==int(label): # it's this label class -> add this pixel intensities into the list\n                    pixels_in_this_bbox.append(intensity_image[x][y])\n        # calculate and append the mean intensity of pixels_in_this_bbox to our list\n        intensity_values.append(np.mean(pixels_in_this_bbox))\n    return intensity_values\n```\nRemember to ensure that your image processing and other libraries are installed before you run this script, as they may not be by default in Python. Also the intensity image usually is noisy for a better result a preprocessing might be applied: like using median filtering or bilateral filter depending on problem. \nIt's important to note that the bounding box algorithm used here is slightly simplified and uses an assumption about the size of the image, it may not handle correctly images whose size/aspect ratio changes much between two frames.", "result": "failed: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'", "passed": false}

But if we assume the input is an image and it should remove all objects that are smaller than a certain size threshold, we can start by writing a plan as comments using python.\n\n1. Firstly, we need to import some Python libraries: numpy for numerical operations, PIL/Pillow or OpenCV for accessing and manipulating pixels of the image.\n2. After importing these libraries, we would then write the function `remove_small_labels:` which will be used later to filter out labels that are too small (i.e., less than a certain size threshold). \n    Let's assume `im_start = user input or a default value if user didn\u2019t input such as im_start == 0` which is the start point of an image (top left corner has (0,0)) and `size_threshold` refers to the minimum size we would consider 'small'.\n    And finally function signature should look like this: `def remove_small_labels(label_image, im_start=im_start, size_threshold=0)`, where `im_start` and `size_threshold` are parameters of that function.\n3. We need to flatten the image and convert it into a one-dimensional list of pixels. For this step, we might use numpy's .flatten() method or iterate through the full image manually in python.\n4.

We store these large labels as tuples of their coordinates (x,y coordinate of pixel) in this array. \n5. Iterate over the flatten pixel list and if a pixel has a higher value than our current largest label then it's a 'large' object and we should include it into our array and assign it to largest_label variable. If it does not and the pixel is less than the threshold, then we should discard it as small.\n6. Once all images are done flattening and filtering, we create labels image of same size by assigning to each pixel its largest label (or number starting from them in reverse).\n7. Return the final filtered image.\n8. Be advised that due to dynamic updating of 'large' regions (as iterating over pixels), actual output might vary slightly as each iteration updates and assigns highest labelled objects, not all previous objects get updated.\n9.

Firstly, we need to import some Python libraries: numpy for numerical operations, PIL/Pillow or OpenCV for accessing and manipulating pixels of the image.\n2. After importing these libraries, we would then write the function `remove_small_labels:` which will be used later to filter out labels that are too small (i.e., less than a certain size threshold). \n    Let's assume `im_start = user input or a default value if user didn\u2019t input such as im_start == 0` which is the start point of an image (top left corner has (0,0)) and `size_threshold` refers to the minimum size we would consider 'small'.\n    And finally function signature should look like this: `def remove_small_labels(label_image, im_start=im_start, size_threshold=0)`, where `im_start` and `size_threshold` are parameters of that function.\n3. We need to flatten the image and convert it into a one-dimensional list of pixels. For this step, we might use numpy's .flatten() method or iterate through the full image manually in python.\n4. Then we initialise an empty list for storing 'large' labels (not too small and not too big, maybe). We store these large labels as tuples of their coordinates (x,y coordinate of pixel) in this array. \n5. Iterate over the flatten pixel list and if a pixel has a higher value than our current largest label then it's a 'large' object and we should include it into our array and assign it to largest_label variable. If it does not and the pixel is less than the threshold, then we should discard it as small.\n6. Once all images are done flattening and filtering, we create labels image of same size by assigning to each pixel its largest label (or number starting from them in reverse).\n7. Return the final filtered image.\n8. Be advised that due to dynamic updating of 'large' regions (as iterating over pixels), actual output might vary slightly as each iteration updates and assigns highest labelled objects, not all previous objects get updated.\n9.

We will be applying a structuring element (a disc) of radius = \"radius\", and then will apply closing operation on the binary image using this element.\nIn Python, we can create such a structure element with the help of `disk` function from scipy's `ndimage.filters` module. \nFollowing is how to implement:\n\n```python\nfrom skimage import filters\n\n# Creating disk structuring element with given radius\nselem = morphology.disk(radius)\n\n# perform closing on the binary image using the structuring element \nclosing_filtered = filters.rank.minimum_filter(binary_image, footprint=selem)\n```  \nIn Python, you can create a new binary image by comparing old and filtered images which were obtained from initial and modified binary_image. A new cell should be created for the result and initially it should be filled with 0. After performing closing operation, fill up the cells where in original image but not found after closing, assign them as 1 to the new binary_image.\n\nFinally return this resultant filtered binary image which contains result of closing operation.", "result": "failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 6)", "passed": false}

To apply the mask to each pixel in the images, you will iterate through every single pixel on your image.

Also note that a given 3D Volume might comprise of sub-objects or clusters whose surface measure would need to be computed separately if you were looking to give an overall surface area measure across all voxels in volume.\n\n**Python libraries:**\n1. `numpy`: This can mainly be used for any numerical computing in Python. It allows us to operate with multi-dimensional arrays of data. \n2.  `scipy` : It provides the tools needed to analyze, cluster and analyze a large dataset as well. The 'surface analysis' functions provided in the scipy library make this easier.\n3. `cv2`: Used for image processing tasks. This is not strictly necessary for what we are trying to achieve but is used if the 3D binary volume was an image or other type of grayscale volumes.\n4. `numba` : It helps in optimising our code for performance, especially in large computations where Python\u2019s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit it's ability to make use of multiple threads/processes.

PIL is a common standard and offers basic functionalities to do with images, but it is not included in python by default so one needs to install it using pip.\n\nOnce we have the needed libraries imported, we need to write down our plan of attack:\n 1. Loading the image using image file provided: The PIL library can open and load images from different sources.\n2. Loading mask: Similar to loading the main image but for masks. We must also ensure that their size matches with the loaded/resized image while keeping its aspect ratio intact.\n3. Applying the mask: Using the mask, pixel-by-pixel assign values to the RGB or another attribute of each pixel in our image; depending if we are dealing with images in grayscale (when mask is binary) or color (if not).

Python does not require a special character for defining functions as it does in some other languages (such as JavaScript or C). However, to follow the exact problem specifications of completing comments on how to solve the problem step-by-step and including the required libraries, we will need to import Pillow library, which is commonly used under the name PIL for reading and manipulating images.\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef sum_images(image1, image2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sums two images pixel-by-pixel and returns the result \n    Import libraries: PIL (Python Imaging Library)\n    \"\"\"\n```\nAfter importing the libraries to do the job we should define a new Image object from each image file. The function will then iterate through all colour layers of these images in parallel, summing the pixel values and writing it back to an output image.\n\nThis is just one way of doing what you are asking for - if the images have different size or different number of channels (color layers), additional checks would need to be done for those. Also note that it doesn't touch with their name nor they could contain unreadable content which would cause image error when reading back.\n\n```python\n    img1 = Image.open(image1) # opening image file in read mode\n    img2 = Image.open(image2) \n    assert img1.size == img2.size, \"Both images must be of the same dimensions!\"      # checking if both images have the same size\n```\nFor looping through pixels:\n\nThe nested for loop will go on each pixel in our image, this is defined by calling pixels for i (horizontal direction) and j (vertical direction). If we sum the pixel values from img1 and img2 then return them to new image, we effectively sum two images pixel-by-pixel and returns the resulting image.\n    \n```python     \n    # Get the dimensions of our images      \n        w, h = img1.size  \n        # Create a blank image for our output, allocate in the same manner as input images     \n        combined_image= Image.new('RGB', (w, h))   \n        for i in range(w):    \n            for j in range(h):      \n                r1 = img1.getpixel((i,j))\n                r2 = img2.getpixel((i,j))  # extracting individual pixel values from the image       \n                combined_image.putpixel((i, j), (int(r1[0]+r2[0])%256, int(r1[1]+r2[1])%256, int(r1[2]+r2[2])%256)) # adding pixel values and taking modulo 256 to ensure pixel value remains within the range [0-255]\n        combined_image.save('combined_image.jpg', 'JPEG')  # saving this image in output format    \n```  \nTo complete this function, include closing statements at end of file like `return combinedImg`\n\nThe return is necessary because python returns value from functions by default which is None if not mentioned otherwise.", "result": "failed: unexpected indent (<string>, line 18)", "passed": false}

Numpy's 'max' function is applied on every row(axis=1) of an image which returns a matrix containing \n   the maximum value in each column along the axes = 0\n5.

First, let's define our plan: We will import the necessary libraries for image processing (PIL/CV2 in case of OpenCV) and calculate the maximum kernel which is commonly used for blurring tasks.\n```python\nimport cv2 as cv\nimport numpy as np\n```\n2. In order to implement the tile-by-tile approach, we will create a function that blurs each subregion of the original image with the maximum filter of given size before combining all the blurred tiles. Our subregion should be determined by slicing the image in chunks of size tile_size and starting from an upper-left corner. If `radius` is equal to 0 this function will return a full blurred image which is then suitable for further processing.\n```python\ndef apply_max_filter(image, radius):\n    # Creating a maximum filter for each edge\n    max_filter = cv.getStructuringElement(cv.MORPH_MAX, (2*radius+1,2*radius+1)) \n    return cv.filter2D(src= image, ddepth=-1, args= max_filter)\n```\n3. Now let's implement the main function 'tiled_image_processing'. We will take an image, tile size and radius as input parameters. We first check if radius is equal to 0. If it is, we call the apply_max_filter method on the whole image, after which it returns blurred image. Otherwise, we slice each part of image by size that includes a tiled border. Apply max filter for this tiled parts and combine them together in original order as they appeared in the list.\n```python\ndef tiled_image_processing(image, radius, tile_size):\n    if radius == 0:\n        return apply_max_filter(image,radius)\n        \n    # Split image into subparts according to size\n    tiles = [image[i:i + tile_size, j:j + tile_size] for i in range(0, image.shape[0], tile_size) \n              for j in range(0, image.shape[1], tile_size)]\n      \n    # Blurring each subregion and assembling them\n    result = np.zeros_like(image)\n    for i, tile in enumerate(tiles):\n        processed_tile = apply_max_filter(tile,radius) \n        mask = ((i % tile_size == 0) & (i // tile_size == 0))\n        result[mask] = processed_tile[mask]\n    return result\n```\n4. Testing the function is pretty straightforward: import image, radius and tile size define what you want to apply to an image. Call your function with this data and print the output. \n```python\nimg = cv.imread('test.jpg',cv.IMREAD_COLOR)\nradius=1\ntile_size=(img.shape[0]//2, img.shape[1]//2) # define it whatever suits your needs\nnewimg = tiled_image_processing(img,radius,tile_size)\n```\nPlease replace 'test.jpg' with the correct path to your image file (It should return blurred version of the original image if radius is equal or larger than 1)", "result": "failed: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'", "passed": false}

This will grow or contract the edges of objects while preserving their shapes.\n```python\ndef segment(image, threshold):\n    return ndimage.binary_dilation(image > threshold).astype('uint8') \n```\nAfter that we implement counting function to return object count, using 'label' function which assigns a unique label to each object and returns the count of unique labels. We also subtract 1 while calling this function as label is assigned starting from 0 in python.\n\nHere is all together:\n```python\ndef workflow_segmentation_counting(image):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function segments objects in an image with intensity above average \n    and returns their count.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reshape the grayscale image to a list of scalar values.\n    npimg = np.array(image)\n    thresh_val=threshold('mean')  # we are setting threshold as mean for simplicity, can change\n    segments = segment(npimg, thresh_val) # Segment the image\n\n    # Get number of objects (components) in image.\n    labels, _ = ndimage.label(segments)\n    return labels -1 \n```  \nThis code segment will return a number representing the different object clusters in your image once you have thresholded and labelled it.

First, we import everything we think we'll need. \n\n2. Now, let's write our plan of attack to solve the problem step-by-step.\n   Our approach will be to use the `sklearn` library and the `segmentation` function in its `cluster` module for segmenting the image based on intensity values above half of the maximum intensity. We need to detect these connected components which will give us distinct objects. \n   For the measurements, we would calculate:\n   - The area or number of pixels in each label.\n   - The perimeter along with its minimum and maximum distance from a border of the label object to another.\n   - The mean value of all intensities within that specific label\n3. Then, import the umap_toolkit (`umap`) library for generating UMAP vector representations.\n4. Then we write our main function `workflow_segment_measure_umap`.\n   This will take as input: the image.\n5. Inside this function, first we perform the label based segmentation based on intensities above half of the maximum intensity. Next step is to detect labeled objects. After that we calculate the area and perimeter for each detected object using a library like `numpy` or with scripting functions. Meanwhile we could also calculate the mean intensity within those bounds using another library such as `np.mean()`. Finally we need to generate UMAP representations out of these measurements, which are stored in dataframe and returned.\n6. We don't write any code for testing function because by its nature a function is meant to be tested, therefore, you should write test scenarios along with the tests code (assert statements) to verify that your function works as intended.\n    \nHere is how we could start writing this code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport numpy as np \nfrom skimage import filters, segmentation, measure, color\n# ... add more imports if needed\n\ndef workflow_segment_measure_umap(image):\n    # Segmentation based on intensity above half of the maximum intensity\n    labels = segmentation.label(image > image.mean()) # Use your image and its parameters here to segment intensities above threshold\n\n    # Getting connected components & their attributes for measurements \n    props = measure.regionprops(labels) \n    # ... get more properties if needed\n\n    # calculating perimeter, area, mean intensity of each component (area_s,perimeter_p,mean_i), and calculate minor and major axis\n    for prop in props:\n        areas.append(prop[\"Area\"])\n        perimeters.append(prop[\"Perimeter\"])\n        avg_intensities.append(np.mean(image[prop['coordinates']])) \n```\n7. After this step, you need to convert your lists into numpy arrays since UMAP expects such structure and pass that to the `umap` function which will provide you with your required vectors.\n8. You may want to define a way of getting/computing these quantities dynamically, possibly through different sub functions.\nNote: It's crucial to note here how intensity threshold may differ based on what was your image\u2019s range and desired segmented pixel values are.

First, create a set of tuples representing the locations (x,y) where we will apply the mask. We need these coords because during the subsequent steps we will need to replace pixels located at those coordinates.\n2. After that, for each coordinate in our set of coords, check if the masked pixel is '0' (in binary images) or has value '0' (in grayscale images indicating background removal) then replace the corresponding location in the image with '0'\n3. If an image is colored and the mask specifies replacement at a particular coordinate considering color channels of RGB, we consider the color intensity for that pixel to be equal to minimum intensity from that channel among all pixels with coordinates matching the same 'xy' value considering other color channels. This is not always true (as colors might have different intensity characteristics) \n4. If an image is colored and the mask specifies replacement at a particular coordinate, we replace that exact pixel value.\n5. Finally, return the modified image after all locations are processed.  \n\nHere is the python code that accomplishes these steps:\n```python\ndef binary_mask_image(image, mask):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a 2D input image and a 2D binary mask image, then applies the mask to input image and returns result.\n    \"\"\"\n    import numpy as np  # import library for array operations in python\n\n    # Creating coordinate lists where pixels with value more than '0' need to be replaced with pixel value '0' considering grayscale images\n    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(image.shape[0]) for j in range(image.shape[1]) if image[i][j]>0 and mask[i][j]==1]\n    for coord in coords:  # Replace each pixel in the masked area with '0'\n        image[coord] = 0\n      \n    return image\n```\n\nTo include handling of color image, we assume that color images are numpy arrays where the pixels at a certain coordinate represent intensity values for all three channels. So when our mask specifies to replace pixel value in grayscale image (mask[i][j]==1), we first check if intensity of corresponding pixel in mask image also falls within reasonable range for grayscale pixel representation (0-255 in RGB, or 0-1 int colors) to avoid runtime errors.\nAlso, while replacing the color pixels, we make sure to preserve the minimum intensity from color channels because it would represent the overall 'color' of the image at that point.\nHere is a python code which includes the condition handling for checking the validity of grayscale pixel range:  \n```python\ndef img_mask_image(image, mask):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a 2D input color image and a 2D binary mask image, then applies the mask to input image.\n    And returns result after all replacements.\n    \"\"\"\n    import numpy as np  # import library for array operations in python\n\n    lo_range = min(min(img[0]), min(mask[0]))   # Pixel intensity range for grayscale image\n    hi_range = max(max(img[0]), max(mask[0])) \n    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(image.shape[0]) for j in range(image.shape[1]) if img[i][j]>lo_range and img[i][j]<hi_range+1 and mask[i][j]==1] \n    for coord in coords:   # Replace each grayscale pixel in masked area with minimum intensity of image.

Convert the images to numpy arrays\n2. Find regions using labels in the label_image. By using connected components, you should be able to separate overlapping regions.\n3. Calculate the area for each region\n4. For perimeter and mean intensity, we will calculate them separately but within each separated region.\n5. Append all results into a pandas DataFrame\n\nHere's how:\n\n```python    \n    label_image = cv2.imread(label_image, 0)  # Open the label image in grayscale (0-1 channel)\n    intensity_image = cv2.imread(intensity_image, -1) # Open the intensity image by itself - without channels specification\n    \n    labels, num_features = cv2.connectedComponents(label_image) \n                             # Connected Components returns two things, labels (which is a set of distinct groups if you join all components together) and number of features.\n```\nFor the remaining calculation parts, we will work with single value arrays for simplification:\n- Convert the arrays to numpy first as it is more efficient than converting images itself\n```python    \n    label_image = cv2.cvtColor(label_image, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR) # Convert to BGR, OpenCV uses this format often \n    intensity_image = cv2.cvtColor(intensity_image, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2RGBX) if np.iscomplexobj(intensity_image) else cv2.cvtColor(intensity_image, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2RGB) # Convert to RGB\n    labels = np.array(labels, copy=False)[label_image] \n```\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter and mean intensity for each region:\n- Calculating for intensity: We use the median of a channel (here, we choose red color for intensity image as it is often present in medical images)\n- For area measure: We can simply count all pixel values equal to region number. We have separated regions already, so no need for another pass over pixels.\n```python    \n    mean_intensity = np.zeros((labels.max() + 1)) # Assuming 0 is not used for separation, hence start indices from 1\n    perimeter = np.zeros((labels.max() + 1))     # Also assuming 0 means background should not be counted as perimeter\n\n    for index in range(1, labels.max()+2): \n        mean_intensity[index] = stats.median(np.nonzero(intensity_image == index)[0]) # For each region, get the mean intensity\n        perimeter[index] = np.sum(labels[:]==index) # Also for each label count number of pixels in region\n```  \n    \nFinally we form our final pandas DataFrame:\n```python   \n    region_dataframe = pd.DataFrame()\n    for i in range(1, labels.max() + 2): # loop from 1 to max number of region found in the image + 1 (to include 0 as a region)\n        temp = {'Area': [perimeter[i]], 'Perimeter':[mean_intensity[i]]}\n        region_dataframe=region_dataframe.append(temp, ignore_index=True) # create new rows of data in DataFrame for each region\n    \n    # assign labels to this df by iterating through max regions found and assigning label as key to the respective value of that index i.e., perimeter and mean intensity\n    region_dataframe['Label'] = np.where(labels[:]!=0, labels[:], 'background') # replace 0 with background label for whole image \n```    \nYou can retrieve this DataFrame as:\n```python   \n    return region_dataframe\n```", "result": "failed: OpenCV(4.10.0) :-1: error: (-5:Bad argument) in function 'imread'\n> Overload resolution failed:\n>  - Expected 'filename' to be a str or path-like object\n>  - Expected 'filename' to be a str or path-like object\n>  - Expected 'filename' to be a str or path-like object\n", "passed": false}

This will serve as the output segmentation where true values point to areas to be segmented and false points to background.\n4. The algorithm will start from the given point. \n5. Check if a pixel on an image is inside the borders and value in that pixel is equal to pixelvalue parameter or not, if it is zero then only proceed. This will avoid out of boundary errors when iterating with respect to the image pixels.\n6. Then using Flood fill algorithm, we replace every connected component of an image (region of white(zero) neighbours around seed point) in labelImage with current true value for all those regions whose values are zeros. Also store the coordinates here as a tuple of int (x, y) of each zero pixel.\n7. Once you traverse through all the pixels, iterate through the coordinate list obtained from step 6 and replace their values in main image with specified 'pixelvalue'.\n8.

Verify that both dataframes have the index columns we want the merge by checking if they're all present in one or both of them. We cannot simply add additional columns if they are not presented in either dataset, because it would overwrite some necessary information.\n2. Use `append()` to combine these two dataframes into a single frame, this operation will fill NaN values with None or 0 if no suitable value is provided.\n3. Now merge the two combined datasets with pandas\u2019s powerful `merge()` function according to our condition of needing the index column in both datasets. This could be accomplished by using list comprehension to get the needed parts of indices, then applying the `pd.Index` function to them as the left and right index parameters.\n4.

A numpy array is created using np.array(list_of_pixels), where list_of_pixels should contain all pixel positions as tuples (i,j). Note that the image has 0 for background and 1 for foreground. In python based images, this is usually accomplished by creating an array with the pixels values from a file or system output etc. Example:\n\n```python\nbinary_image = np.array([[0,0,1,0],\n                        [0,0,1,0],\n                        [1,0,0,1],\n                        [0,0,1,0]])\n                       \nlabels,num_objects = label_binary_image_and_count_labels(binary_image)\nprint('Num Objects: ', num_objects)  # This will output 3 which is the number of objects in binary image.\n```", "result": "failed: name 'np' is not defined", "passed": false}

The grayscale formula `0.299r + 0.701g + 0.1683b` might seem alien if you're not familiar with it but the algorithm uses these constants in a gray level conversion equation that makes it possible to convert an RGB image into grayscale while retaining as much of its color as possible, even on black and white output.\n\nStep 4:\nOutput the image (in grayscale) using Pillow's own function. This will return as a PIL/Image object and will be able to properly display the resulting grayscale image in Jupyter Notebook or any graphical interface you're using for Python debugging etc.\n\nStep 5:\nYou want to make sure that weights `r`, `g`, and `b` are normalized such that sum equals to 1 (the grayscale formula takes these weighted averages, so they shouldn't need to add up a total greater than 1).

The Canny Edge Detection method applies an edge detection filter (Gradient Descent) along each axis of an image, which is useful for finding edges. \nThe Gradient Descent for each pixel gives us the direction of edges and magnitude gives us strength of edges. These can be further processed to find a good threshold value for binarising(or detecting) edges based on local pattern analysis.\n \n```python\ndef detect_edges(image):\n    gray=cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n```\n5.

For each channel (RGB), we iterate over all points within our radius. Each point will form a rectangle on which to draw a circle of points. Because this rectangle is within a pixel distance-1 from any prior pixels representing an object and its new pixel will be within pixel distance 0, there shouldn't be any overlap between the rectangle drawn in one channel and the other channel.\n   \n6. We then create a circular mask over these rectangles by using the draw function from the skimage. This allows us to easily draw the circle shaped paths we want to expand each individual label with.

Libraries like matplotlib are also useful if you want to visualize or print your output. \n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n```\n\n2. Then define a function \"region_growing\" that takes image and initial point as inputs, performs region growing in the image and returns the final segmentation as an image.\n\n3. Inside this function:\n   - Use OpenCV's \"connectTwoContour\" method which connects a point to its nearest neighbour considering border as well (so every pixel is connected with other border pixels). We'll use this later, after a certain threshold for a new region in the image.\n   \n4. Define the minimum number of neighbours that will form a region of interest. This can be specified by you, but I'm assuming here it is 4.\n\n```python\nnbr_points = 4\n```\n\n5. Within this function:\n   - Initialize an empty grayscale image with size in a similar way to the original image for storing new regions.\n   - Flood fill algorithm takes two arguments, start point and color. To start from the given point we have to provide this image to be modified and start pixel color which is assumed here as 0.\n *You might want to add error handling if the provided point doesn't exist in the initial image - in that case, return an appropriate error message and stop execution.*\n\n6. Also, inside this function, define a variable \"threshold\" to decide on how much difference we are willing to tolerate between pixel values for our algorithm to recognize them as belonging to one connected component (or region) and to another.\n  \n7. Inside the function, iterate over all pixels in the image row and column wise. \n   - For every pixel:\n     - Calculate the Euclidean distance of this point from the initial point provided by the user. If it's less than or equal to our \"threshold\" then consider this as part of the new region that we will connect to existing regions.\n *Modify the above step to check if a pixel has already been added into an existing component and skip, if so.*\n     - Use the \"cv2.connectedComponentsWithOutputLabels(image)\" method. This will give us not only connectivity information (in terms of connecting pixels together) but also the final labeling for all connected components. \n     \n8. Inside this function:\n   - Iterate over the array. For every pixel, if it's part of the initial image but has been labeled as 0 i.e. not an initially identified main structure then this is a new region and we will flood fill from there until we reach back to previously identified main structures that are more than our minimum region size (nbr_points) on this channel.\n\n9. Inside the function:\n   - Display intermediate segmented images if provided by user request.\n   - After all points are checked for connected components which doesn't have any connections with initial structures then label of component will be assigned 255 as color and also add it to an image that we can later return as output/segmented image.\n\n10. When no more unseen pixels left, the final result should contain our desired resultant labelled image with each representing a structure (component) in separated colors with some sort of threshold control in their coloring depending on user requirements.\n   \nPlease remember that this is a basic algorithm and there are many improvements which you can do, such as improving the region growing by iterating over a larger range of pixel locations, applying different algorithms for segmentations like thresholding, adaptive threshold operations etc within your given constraints. You might also want to use morphology (e.g. opening or closing operation) to remove small noise at edges of image/segmentation.

Next we define our function. The steps included in the commented comments are implemented in this function:\n    ```python\ndef workflow_watershed_segmentation_correction_measurement(image):\n```\n3. Use `filters.gaussian()` to blur the original image, so that all of its local features, especially edges, can be detected, allowing us to identify local minima in a blurred image. This can help improve the accuracy of our segmentation. \n4. Apply `ndimage.label()` on the blurred image, which will return all unique foreground areas and their respective labels (from 0 to n).\n5. Define a function for cleaning the image:\n```python    \ndef clean_up(labels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Remove objects that touch the edge of the image\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = labels.shape\n    coords = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]  # N, S, E, W directions\n                                               \n    for i in range(1, height-1):           \n        for j in range(1, width-1):          \n            if labels[i][j] > 0:\n                for x, y in coords:             \n                    if labels[i+x][j+y] == 0:\n                        labels[i][j] = 0       # If we touch a background pixel (0) then set the label/object as 0.

To improve this function we might need more advanced versions or other machine learning algorithms to accurately estimate objects.\n\n8. The workflow could be then implemented in a loop where an image is read, passed to this function, and a visualization of both input images are shown:    \n```python\nimage_read = skio.imread('path-to-test-file')   # Load the image or use other methods \nblurred_img = filters.gaussian(img)              # Apply blurring \nlabels = ndimage.label(blurred)[0]               # Label the objects\ncleaned_label = clean_up(labels)                 # Clean up\nplt.imshow(image, 'gray')                       # Print original image\nplt.show()                                      \nplt.imshow(blurred_img, 'gray')                  # Show blurred image        \nplt.show()\n```\nPlease replace the image `'path-to-test-file'` with your image directory or url (if you want to load an image).

Depending on the requirements, you might need additional Python libraries like matplotlib or SciPy for visualizations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import ndimage as ndi\nfrom PIL import Image\n```\nStep 2: Define a function to perform region growing. This function takes an image (as a Numpy array) and a seed point as input, then uses this point to expand the flood fill by finding pixels in the same connected regions.\n\nFor example,\n\n```python\ndef region_growing(image, seed_pts, initial_label=0):\n    labels = {} #to store the labels of each connected component\n    q = [] #a queue for performing BFS\n    visited = np.zeros((image.shape[0], image.shape[1]), dtype=int) \n              #a boolean matrix to track visited pixels\n    for p in seed_pts: \n        q.append(p) |> q.extend(list(getConnectedPixels(p))) #add connected pixels of the seeds into queue\n    while len(q):\n        point = q.pop(0)  #take an element from the front of the queue\n        label = initial_label +1 \n        image[int(point[0]), int(point[1])]= label #assign the label to the pixel at seed location\n        labels[point] = label #store the label of this point\n```\nStep 3: Write a function to get all connected pixels given a point. This is done using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Add this code inside region_growing() function.\n\nFor example,\n```python\ndef getConnectedPixels(point):\n    r0, c0 = point \n    numRows, numCols = image.shape[:2]\n    connectedPixels = [(i,j) for i in range(max(0, r0-1), min(numRows, r0+2))\n                     for j in range(max(0, c0-1), min(numCols, c0+2)) if image[i,j] == 0 ]\n    return connectedPixels\n```\nPlease adjust this function according to whether or not you want to include the boundary pixels. The above approach includes them by using range() with numRows and numCols as start and end bound of each pixel search. You may need to modify it based on your specific needs.\n\nIn total, the complete code is:\n```python\ndef region_growing(image, seed_pts, initial_label=0): \n    labels = {}  #to store the labels of each connected component\n    q = [] #a queue for performing BFS \n    visited = np.zeros((image.shape[0], image.shape[1]), dtype=int) \n              #a boolean matrix to track visited pixels\n    for p in seed_pts: \n        q.append(p) |> q.extend(list(getConnectedPixels(p))) #add connected pixels of the seeds into queue\n    while len(q):\n        point = q.pop(0)  #take an element from the front of the queue\n        label = initial_label +1 \n        image[int(point[0]), int(point[1])]= label #assign the label to the pixel at seed location\n        labels[point] = label #store the label of this point\n    return labels\n```\nThe above function returns a dictionary (where key is a tuple representing locations and value is their associated labels) for the labeled regions.\nFinally, adjust the function arguments according to your specific problem needs.", "result": "failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 16)", "passed": false}

First, we should import the required libraries. We will use OpenCV which is specifically designed to handle image and array manipulations in Python. We need to have Numpy for handling array computations and NumPy for numerical operations. Sci-Kit Image is another handy set of functions that deals with images (in addition to those of Numpy/OpenCV).\n\n2. Create a function called remove_small_labels which will filter the labels to see if each label object in our image is large enough to continue.\n\n3. The function needs to take three arguments:\n    a) The input labeled image (or mask, whatever your library of choice calls it). \n    b) An optional size threshold. If this is not provided (i.e., its value is 0), then we will assume that no threshold has been set and therefore all objects should be removed.\n\nHere's a very crude way to do the same using OpenCV: \n```python\n    def remove_small_labels(label_image, size_threshold=0):\n        h, w = label_image.shape[:2] # get height and width of image\n        min_object_size = h * size_threshold if size_threshold > 0 else 1   # If a value is given, use it as the threshold.

Afterpadded image is then processed. In this step, each pixel's intensity is subtracted with mean of the pixels in it`s original slice to make all the intensities equal to zero. This process ensures that when applying filter, intensity doesn't change drastically from the original intensity which is required for convolution operation with this filter. Afterwards the filter matrix is padded if necessary on its boundaries to match image size. Now the filtered version of each sub region image tile (after padding) is calculated and finally these tiles are combined to give final result as a 2D matrix.", "result": "failed: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') with casting rule 'same_kind'", "passed": false}

This might entail looping through all combinations of possible centers and considering which pair works best (by smallest difference for example).\n\nStep3: Since our input is a list of 2D points, we need to translate this into a simple format where each pair can be considered as a 'point'. A tuple like [x0,y0] would become (xi-xo)/r, where xi and yi are the actual coordinates, while xo is arbitrary, being a function of chosen center (xc) and the distance between pairs. The algorithm could take these points into account when choosing the candidate for minimal difference.\n\nStep4: Implement this plan within the appropriate Python function. We must iterate over all pairs of points, calculating the distances to each point and using this information to find which pair provides the minimum overall discrepancy.

If you have images which do not have int32 for labels, OpenCV will need to convert those types internally. For example, if your image uses uint8 for storing the pixel values instead of int32, in such cases you should convert your label values accordingly.\n\nThe function basically takes an input array (e.g. image) and then it creates a dictionary that stores label => pixel count mapping. Then it creates a result image where if a particular label's value is found in the dictionary as key this key with its corresponding value from the dictionary will be replaced by this label's value in original image.\n\nThen for each connection point (connected to more than one other components) add another layer of abstraction, we need to count pixels connected to it:\n```python\npixels_count = 0  # initialize counter\nfor i in range(label_image.shape[0] - 1):  # loop over rows of image\n    for j in range(label_image.shape[1] - 1):  # loop over columns of this row\n        if (i > 0 and label_image[i-1,j] == label) or (j>0 and label_image[i,j-1] == label): # if pixel connects to other labels\n            pixels_count += 1  # increase counter\nlabel_with_pixelcnt = label * np.ones((label_image.shape[0], label_image.shape[1])) # new image filled with this label value for all pixels\n```\nFinally we replace original labels (stored in `label_image`) by the pixel count for each connected component. This operation isn't really performed until the final image is displayed to allow us to verify the result from our operation. \n\nThis is a simple implementation and there might be different strategies depending on your problem use case, such as whether you want to create a new labelled image or in place replace existing labels with pixel count.", "result": "failed: name 'label_image' is not defined", "passed": false}

When all regions having areas larger than threshold are selected, iterate over this set and remove the smaller ones.\n\n```python\ndef remove_small_labels(label_image, size_threshold = 0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a label_image and removes all objects that are smaller than a given size_threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convolution matrix for structuring element with radius r:\n    kernel2 = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_GRADIENT, (3,3))\n  \n    # Remove small objects using Connected Component Analysis (CCA):\n    labels, n_objects = cv2.connectedComponentsWithStates(label_image)  # Returns connected components and their binary image state. \n    # We only care about regions of the original image and not the ones that have been dilated.\n    objectAreas = np.amax(n_objects[~np.isnan(n_objects)], axis=0)       # Gets the area (number of pixels) for each object by counting the unique connected components.\n    keep = objectAreas > size_threshold    # Keep only large objects \n  \n    newLabels = np.zeros((label_image.shape[0], label_image.shape[1]), dtype=int) # Create new labels, we will use this to paste our filtered image back into the original image.\n    uniqueRegions = np.unique(n_objects[:,:,1])   # Retrieve unique regions (labels)  \n    for region in range(len(uniqueRegions)): \n        if keep[region] == False: # This means an object with this label is small and should be removed\n            continue\n        newLabels[np.where(label_image==uniqueRegions[region]),:] = 0  # Zero out (this region) in the final image, effectively removing it.\n\n    return newLabels # Return your answer: Filtered label image with small regions removed.\n```  \n3. Call function: You are finally required to provide a testcase for these functions and make sure they work correctly. For instance:\n\n```python\nimg = cv2.imread('lena.png')   # Read lena.jpg as image\ngray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # Convert it to grayscale.\nret,labels=cv2.connectedComponents(gray) # Connected component analysis for connected components (CCA)\nremove_small_labels(labels, size_threshold = 50)  # Call the function with appropriate testcase. It is not required if there are different sizes, just try the default values like it was initially designed.\n```   \nAs an image processing task and algorithms are always dependent on your code design perspective, you can modify above solution according to your needs without fear of breaking anything.", "result": "failed: OpenCV(4.10.0) D:\\a\\opencv-python\\opencv-python\\opencv\\modules\\imgproc\\src\\color.cpp:196: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cv::cvtColor'\n", "passed": false}

You may also have another dimension to represent additional features/dimensions you might include if required for your specific problem.\nNow let's implement this into a Python function:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import ndimage as ndi\n\ndef tiled_image_processing(image, radius=1, tile_size=32):\n    \"\"\"\n    Apply a smoothing filter to image tiles.\n    This process is done tile-wise because the problem we are trying to solve requires that all pixels of each individual image (or subset if your data is tiled) be processed individually.\n    \n    image: numpy array, size H x W with C color channels (representing R,G,B values for a red, green and blue input image respectively)\n    radius: pixel radius for the maximum filter\n    tile_size: size for each tile in X & Y dimensions before merging tiles back into original image.\n\n    returns the smoothed image after applying max filter to each tile.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split our image into tiles of size tile_size x tile_size\n    h, w = image.shape\n    tile = np.zeros((tile_size, tile_size, 3))\n    image_tiles = np.array([((x//tile_size, y//tile_size), ((x % tile_size, y % tile_size))) for x in range(w-1) for y in range(h-1)])\n\n    # Apply max filter (smoothing operation by creating a filter kernel of radius+1 elements around each pixel\n    for i, j in image_tiles:\n        tile[j] = ndi.maximum_filter(image[i], size=radius + 1)\n\n    # Now merge back the tiles into original image along with preserving their actual colors\n    for (x, y), vals in zip(image_tiles, tile):\n        image[x] = np.where(image[x] == 0, vals * 255, image[x] + vals * 255)\n      \n    return image\n```   \nThis should be your function now which you can test on your sample inputs to see if it meets the problem requirements accurately.", "result": "failed: shape mismatch: value array of shape (2,6) could not be broadcast to indexing result of shape (2,3,3)", "passed": false}

Here's an outline of how you can design your workflow:\n\n1. Import Necessary Python Libraries:\nYou will need to import `os` python library for file handling, `cv2` for image processing (to load and manipulate images) and `numpy` for numerical operations like mean, min max calculation etc.\n  \n```python\nimport os\nimport cv2 \nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n2. Define the Function:\nYou can consider this function to be 'workflow_batch_process_folder_measure_intensity'. This function accepts two inputs: `image_path`, a string that includes the path of the image folder and `labels_path` - the path of the labels folder.\n\n```python\ndef workflow_batch_process_folder_measure_intensity(image_path, labels_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    This functions goes through all .tif image files in a specified image folder \n    and corresponding label images in another labels folder. \n    It loads the images and corresponding labels, and measures min, mean and max intensity of all labels.\n    The function returns a dataframe with five columns: min_intensity, mean_intensity, max_intensity, label and filename.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n3. Initialize Variables and Dataframes:\nCreate a dictionary to store the results and as a pandas data frame later on, for easy manipulation and visualization of measurements.\n  \n```python\nresults = {\"label\": [], \"min_intensity\":[], \"mean_intensity\":[], \"max_ intensity\":[]}\n```\n4. Loop Through Labels:\nIn the loop through the images in both folders, ensure you're only dealing with .tif files (not necessary but it's safer). \nYou can loop using 'os' library for finding all the image and label paths.\n  \n```python\nfor filename in sorted(os.listdir(image_path)):\n    if '.tif' not in filename:   # filter out non-tif files\n        continue\n    label_filename = os.path.join(labels_path, filename) # get the path of corresponding label file\n```\n5. Load and Process Images:\nOpen both images, apply OpenCV to read the image and measure min, mean, max intensities for each label in the file. You will need to adjust your image processing based on how the labels are stored or how you want to process the images themselves like blurring, rescaling etc.\n   \n```python\n    image = cv2.imread(os.path.join(image_path, filename), cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)  \n    label = cv2.imread(label_filename, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) \n```\n6. Measure Intensity:\nYou will need to use OpenCV functions to find minimum intensity, maximum intensity and mean intensity using cv2.MinMaxRgbConvolume() function for finding min max intensity of color image but grayscale is the same as calculating intensity. Use numpy to do appropriate transformations on your images to measure intensity.\n \n```python\n    min_intensity = np.amin(image) # minimum intensity in grayscale\n      \n    max_intensity, mean_intensity = cv2.minMaxIdx(image)[:-1] # min and max in index form (as 0 is for min and 1 is for maximum in cv2.MINMAXLOCAL_)\n```\n7. Append Data to the Dataframe:\nAppend the intensity measurements along with image name and label to respective lists inside the results dict. \n\n8. Return the Results:\nAfter going through all files, you can return the results dataframe.\n  \n9. The Entire Code:\nHere is a comprehensive code snippet that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport cv2 \nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef workflow_batch_process_folder_measure_intensity(image_path, labels_path):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    results = {}\n    \n    # Loop through image files and corresponding label files in the folders   \n    for filename in sorted(os.listdir(image_path)):\n        if '.tif' not in filename:  # filter out non-tif files\n            continue\n        results[filename] = {} \n        label_filename = os.path.join<|endoftext@ labels_path, filename) # get the path of corresponding label file          \n    image = cv2.imread(os.path.join(image_path, filename), cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)  \n    label = cv2.imread(label_filename, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)       \n```\n\n```python          \n   # calculate min max intensity of the image:\n    min_intensity, _ = cv2.minMaxLoc(image.astype(np.float32)) \n    max_intensity, mean_intensity  = cv2.minMaxIdx(image)[:-1] # min and max in index form (as 0 is for min and 1 is for maximum in cv2.MinMaxIdx()) \n```           \n```python            \n    results[filename] = {'min': int(np.round(min_intensity)),  # round to nearest integer       \n                          'max': int(np.round(max_intensity)),      \n                          'mean': int(np.round(mean_intensity))}     \n```        \nreturn results           \n   \nYou should modify this function depending on how you want to process and store the intensity information of each image.", "result": "failed: unmatched ')' (<string>, line 49)", "passed": false}

First of all, image handling operations in Python generally require the 'PIL' library (Python Imaging Library), which is imported using \"from PIL import Image\" at the top of your code.\nThen, depending on how you want to calculate the dimensions, here are possible strategies:\n\n1. Use built-in functions like `os.stat()` or `os.path.getsize()` to get the file size and then compute width and height from size. Note that this method doesn't return an actual open image for reading which might be a disadvantage if you need more memory.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef open_image_return_dimensions(image_file_location):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function opens the image and returns its dimensions in pixels. \n    In return_tuple, 0 is width and 1 is height.\n    If there are any errors like file not found or invalid type etc., it will return None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if file exists\n    if not os.path.exists(image_file_location):\n        return None\n\n    # Get actual width and height\n    try:\n        with Image.open(image_file_location) as image: # This will open the image while also reading its meta data\n            return (image.width, image.height) \n    except Exception: # Catch all exceptions that might occur during this process\n        return None\n```\n   \n2. Alternatively, without using actual memory storage for image, you can read in chunks the file line by line or in small steps while reading it from filesystem.

One common method is Median Cut Coadaptation (MC3) or Linear Iterative Denoising (LIN) that provide better results for noise than many of the standard alternatives like Gaussian or mean-based methods. \nFor implementing the algorithm, we will use Scikit-Image, a popular Python library for image processing. We will also make use of the cv2 library to perform edge detection and bilateral filtering algorithms. The idea behind both is to preserve edges while removing noise. Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport cv2 as cv #opencv library to perform operations on images \nimport skimage # used for image processing\nfrom skimage import filters, restore  # Libraries required for denoising and restoration of images\n\ndef remove_noise_edge_preserving(image, radius=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies an edge-preserving noise-removal filter to an image. \n    \"\"\"\n    assert (len(image.shape) <= 2), 'Only grayscale images are supported'\n      \n    # Convert the original image into a matrix of greyscale values\n    gray = skimage.color.rgb2gray(image)\n\n    # Convert greyscale image to float and apply bilateral filter\n    bilateral_filter_output= filters.gaussian( gray,sigmaX = radius, sigmaY=radius ) \n\n    # Applying the median blur to make denoising smoother\n    median_blur= cv.medianBlur( np.float64(bilatiral_filter_ouptut), 7 * 2 ) \n\n    # Restore image by applying the blurred image as initial restoration\n    denoised_image = restore.denoise_bilateral(gray, sigma = radius ) \n  \n    return denoised_image  \n```\nIn this code, bilateral filtering is used to preserve edges while removing noise, following with a median blur function and finally applying the denoising method again keeping it\u2019s initial restoration.\n\nIt should be noted that since cv2 uses the PNM (Portable Network Graphics 1.0) format as an internal image representation, in order to manipulate these images you will still need to use OpenCV's image processing/ I/O functions.\nFor testing this code you can simply call your function with a test image as parameter and print or return the result.

We can write below code assuming Python is being used:\n\n```python\n# import libraries if required\nimport copy                 # For Deep Copy to avoid changing the original input \n                            # (or, use list/array built-in operations with less depth)\n\ndef rotate_image_by_90_degrees(im):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a '2D matrix' im, return its rotated 2D matrix by rotating by 90 degrees. \n    \"\"\"\n    rotated = copy.deepcopy(im) # create duplicate list/matrix, to keep original intact (optional)\n                               # or do in situ rotation without needing additional space\n    for i in range(len(im)):\n        for j in range(len(im[0])):\n            rotated[j][-(i+1)] = im[i][j] # note the change of indices, for clockwise 90 degrees\n                               # 'im'[0] will make it a 2-d list rather than [row][column], so need to access element by index]\n    return rotated  # return the new rotated 2D matrix\n```\nRemember that this function changes the input matrix in place (i.e., it modifies the original matrix), as does all python arrays or lists automatically unless specified otherwise. \nWe did not implement any testing at the moment. You might need to consider adding some tests/assertions/profiling on the output of your function for correctness if needed according to your definition. \nYou also may want to add the feature to handle edge cases based on whether or not the input is valid etc - these could vary depending on how strict you see as \"a rotation by 90 degrees\".", "result": "passed", "passed": true}

This is done to retrieve a label image. \n4. From this labelled image, we remove all those regions that touch the border of the original input image. \n5. Lastly, we calculate the area of the remaining clusters/objects and return it. \n\nOnce this function has been written down, write python code only, test the function with an example image, and return complete code including my code.\nThe Python code is as follows:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nfrom skimage import filters, measure\nfrom skimage.morphology import watershed\nimport cv2  # Used for blurring image (optional)\n\ndef workflow_watershed_segmentation_correction_measurement(image):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function implements a workflow consisting of these steps:\n    * blurs the image a bit\n    * detect local minima in the blurred image\n    * apply watershed segmentation from the detected minima to retrieve a label image\n    * remove all objects which touch the image border\n    * measure the area of all remaining objects together\n    \"\"\"\n    # Make sure the input is numpy array\n    if not isinstance(image, np.ndarray):\n        raise ValueError('Input should be a numpy array (ndarray object in python)')\n\n    # If image is grayscale, convert it to 2-channel by duplicating the pixel values.\n    if len(image.shape) == 1:\n        print(\"Grayscale image, converting to color with duplicates.\")\n        image = np.dstack([image, image, image])\n\n    # Blur the input (optional but recommended for watershed)\n    # note that for better performance we can convert to grayscale and enhance our blur strength\n    if cv2 is not None: \n        image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), sigmaX=0)\n    else:\n        print(\"OpenCV has not been found!\")\n    \n    # Find local minima in blurred image\n    minimums = scipy.ndimage.local_ min(image)[0][1]\n    \n    # Use watershed to segment the image around these local minima\n    labels = watershed(- image, minimums)\n    \n    # Remove regions that touch border of image. Note we only work with 2D images at this stage.\n    if len(image.shape)>=3:\n        borders = [(0,i) for i in range(1,len(labels.shape)-1)] + [(i,0) for i in range(1,len(labels.shape[0])-1)] \n        labels_copy = np.copy(labels)\n        for border in borders:\n            label = tuple([np.int_(0)] + list(border)) # label (x,y) -> (0,x or y) \n            labels[label] = 0\n    areas = measure.label(image==0)[1]  # Measure area of all regions that touch border by counting zero pixels\n                                        # and taking away the first one\n    return np.sum(areas[np.nonzero(labels)]) # Returning sum of areas.\n```", "result": "failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 43)", "passed": false}
